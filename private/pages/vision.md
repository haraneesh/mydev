Healthy food is a must for healthy life. In our food system, it is complicated, the way in which food is grown and is distributed. It is almost impossible to make good healthy choices for our families. 

We want to change that. 

We have set ourselves a mission. It is to make it effortless for our families to consume healthy food that nourishes and replenishes us.

This is our plan for making this goal a reality.

### 1. Organic Farming
We have to start at the source. Farming healthy food sustainably is paramount. Luckily this is an age old problem. Our ancestors have perfected it severals years back and have practiced them for hundred of centuries. We only have to look a few decades back to learn of these sustainable practices. 

Use of chemicals, pesticides and preservatives is a very new practice. It crept in to our ways slowly. We have failed to notice it until recently. Now like minded people are helping to reverse it.

All the produce here that is available is truely organic because it is either grown organically by us in our farms or comes from partnering farmer friends whom we have carefully vetted.

### 2. Shorten Supply Chain
To get most from our food we have to eat it fresh. Shortening the supply chain is only way to maintain genuine freshness.

We are pioneering several approaches, that deliver fresher, high-quality food from the farm directly to you, avoiding long and wasteful detours at costly grocery stores.

Since there are NO preservatives, if the food is not fresh you can tell.

### 3. Healthy Diet
To maintaing good health and to feel our best, Eating a healthy, balanced diet is necessary. Keeping track of the diet and ensuring that we feed our families with food containing appropriate proportions of macro and micro nutrients is very hard. We are trying that easy by rotating the food available in the week and by introducing seasonal food.

We are proud that all the produce is devoid of pesticides, preservative and artificial coloring and any chemical agents that are harmful.
